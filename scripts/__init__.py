"""Calculates pixel-quality related matrics for a thermal camera, given properly measured and stored input images for the camera.

Modules exported by this package:

- `nedt`: Calculates the NEDT-value for a camera with a specific integration time.
- `mtf`: Calculates the plots of the step response and mtf for a camera.
- `distortion`: Calculates the distorsion matrix of a camera.
- `temperature`: Calculates the temperature standard deviation for a camera compared to measurements from a cooled camera.
